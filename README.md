# Pi Esimation
Who doesn't love pi? To test out some stuff I had learned in Analysis, I wrote a few different programs to approximate pi. Some of them are vastly more efficient than others; some take advantage of multiple cores; it's just a fun learning activity. Might come back and add some more this Pi Day  :)
